# TheEye
A portable PHP Public Shell script commonly used as a back door to access target webservers.

### So What is this?
I found this piece of code implanted as a payload on one of my clients web servers. It basically functions as an all-purpose back door shell in which the malicious user can upload anything he/she chooses. I kept it because I admired the enginuity and because I wanted to learn more about how it worked with common PHP server functions.
